## Delegate Assignment
- ### Requirements:
	- You must have the Teams Administrator role at minimum to use this script
	- The following modules are used. If they are not installed, the script will prompt for their installation:
		- Microsoft.Graph.Users
		- Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
		- MicrosoftTeams

- ### Usage:
	- This script will assign new delegates to a user and set the user's call settings to also ring delegates. 
	- Please reference the SampleData.csv as an example input file
	- The delegate assignment script reads in the following information from the selected csv file:
		- User Principle Name
			- UPN of the user
			- **Required**
		- Delegates
			- This field allows for multiple delegates to be assigned to one user by seperating the delegates with a comma and enclosing everyting within quotes
				- Example: "user01@domain.com,user02@domain.com,user03@domain.com"
	- The user will be verified that they exist within Entra Active Directory
		- If they exist, they will be provisioned according to the input file
		- If they do not exist, an error will be logged and the next user will be checked. 
	- A log file will be created and log all successful and failed provisioning attempts
		- The "Logs" directory will be created within the same directory you are running the script from.
		- If you do not run the script with Admin privleges, you will need to create the 'Logs' folder before running the script.
