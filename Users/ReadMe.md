## User Provisioning
- ### Requirements:
	- You must have the Teams Administrator role at minimum to use this script
	- The following modules are used. If they are not installed, the script will prompt for their installation:
		- Microsoft.Graph.Users
		- Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
		- MicrosoftTeams

- ### Usage:
	- The user provisioning script will read in a .csv file that contains the following information:
		- UserPrincipalName
			- UPN of the user
			- **Required**
		- Phone Number
			- e164 formatted (ex. +12125551234)
		- Extension
			- Only used when assigning extensions
			- If the user will only have an extension, the phone number will be a shared main number.
		- Type
			- OperatorConnect or DirectRouting
		- Location
			- Name corresponds to previously created Emergency Locations
		- Voice Routing Policy
			- Name of voice routing policy to be assigned
		- Emergency Calling Policy

	- The user will be verified that they exist within Entra ID
		- If they exist, they will be provisioned according to the input file
		- If they do not exist, an error will be logged and the next user will be checked. 
	- A log file will be created and log all successful and failed provisioning attempts
		- The "Logs" directory will be created within the same directory you are running the script from.
		- If you do not run the script with Admin privleges, you will need to create the 'Logs' folder before running the script.
